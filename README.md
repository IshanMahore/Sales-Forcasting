📈 Sales Forecasting using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

Sales Forecasting is a data science project that aims to predict future sales based on historical sales data. Accurate sales forecasting helps businesses make informed decisions related to inventory management, demand planning, budgeting, and revenue optimization.
This project applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques to analyze sales trends and generate reliable forecasts.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze historical sales data to identify trends and patterns
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
Visualize sales performance over time
Build and evaluate machine learning models for sales prediction
Provide insights that support data-driven business decisions

🗂️ Dataset

The dataset contains historical sales records
Features may include:

Date / Time
Sales values
Product or category details (if available)
Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, formatting dates, and feature engineering

🛠️ Technologies Used
